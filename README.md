## Hello!
I am a dev that does whatever I feel like, whether that be chromebook exploits, writing plugins for Minecraft servers, or learning a new language because why not. I enjoy doing whatever I feel like and don't normally finsih projects but I like starting them. Feel free to reach out to me on discord @CasualFrosty#4649. Thanks for being interested!
